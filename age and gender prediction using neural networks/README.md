# intoduction:
facial recognition or detection is frontier development in artificial intelligence specially in the field of surviellence. The three key attributes that can be used in facial detection are:
1. gender
2. age
3. expression

In this project we are going to build a facial recognition model that can predict gender and age by analysing visual inputs.
We are using deep learning approach for the project by using a convolutional nerua network architectue for predcition process. 

# deep learning:
deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that build advanced ML algorithms by using a architecture called neural networks. Deep learning alorithms can peroform a brain mimicking function such as classificaion, regression, clustering, etc. 

# neural networks:
Deep learning algorithms contains archtectural foundation called 'artificial neural networks' that can mimic the functional human brain.
